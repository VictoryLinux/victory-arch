# Victory-Arch

New project just started on it, is a forked project from eznix

to check out his great work go to:

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezos/
   
# Forked from ArcoLinuxD Gnome desktop

This will be a personal setup of Archlinux. I make this available to anyone to use or change.

This is a continual work in progress to try to create as close to a perfect base setup as I can.

Scripts to achieve Archlinux Victory Edition the long way.

# Installation Process


This is NOT a silent install

you will be asked several questions as it progresses



Run the ArchLinux Iso to install the framework.
      
   https://www.archlinux.org/download/

Run these commands in this order:


    git clone https://github.com/VictoryLinux/victory-arch

    bash victory-arch.bios (or .uefi)
    
This will install Gnome DE + GDM + base packages

Load the script into your favorite test editor and edit it if you wish to add or remove packages from the script.

If you wish to install other desktop environments check out EZNIX sourceforge repo
